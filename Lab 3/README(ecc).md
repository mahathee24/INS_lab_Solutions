Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) Key Exchange
This Python program demonstrates a basic Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) key exchange algorithm. The algorithm allows two users (User A and User B) to securely generate a shared secret key using their private keys and a common base point.

Steps in the program:

Private Key Generation:

    Each user, A and B, has a private key (na and nb).
Public Key Generation:

    User A generates their public key by multiplying their private key (na) with a common generator point G.
    User B generates their public key by multiplying their private key (nb) with the same generator point G.
Shared Secret Key Calculation:

    User A computes their secret key using User B's public key and their own private key.
    Similarly, User B computes their secret key using User A's public key and their own private key.
Output:

    The shared secret keys for both User A and User B are printed. In theory, both should be identical if the algorithm is correctly implemented.
Functions:

    generate_secretkey_userA(pub_key_B, na): Computes the secret key for User A using User B's public key and User A’s private key.
    generate_secretkey_userB(pub_key_A, nb): Computes the secret key for User B using User A's public key and User B’s private key.
    ecc_encryption(): Placeholder function for encryption logic (not yet implemented).
    ecc_decryption(): Placeholder function for decryption logic (not yet implemented).
Note: The actual implementation of elliptic curve operations is more complex and requires working with elliptic curve points, but this simplified version uses basic integer multiplication for demonstration purposes.
